# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio! 🚀

I'm a **Freelance Full-Stack Mobile & Web Developer** with **3 years of experience**, and over time, I’ve learned that **frameworks and languages change, but strong core skills remain valuable.**

Many developers rely on high-level tools that simplify programming, but I focus on **understanding the core mechanics behind the code**—allowing me to adapt, build efficiently, and deliver reliable applications across platforms.

## 📌 My Approach to Development  

Rather than chasing every new tool, I focus on the **fundamentals** that drive modern software:  

- **Algorithm Design & Computational Thinking** – Writing efficient, scalable logic.  
- **Mathematics & Physics** – Simulating behaviors, animations, and physics interactions.  
- **Database & Data Structures** – Structuring data for speed, reliability, and scalability.  
- **Rendering & Graphics** – Optimizing visuals using **Metal (iOS), WebGL, and Canvas**.  
- **Networking & API Design** – Ensuring seamless communication across services.  
- **Frontend Architecture & UI/UX** – Crafting efficient, intuitive, and responsive designs using **SwiftUI, React, and Next.js**.  

This allows me to **adapt to different tech stacks**—whether it's **Swift, JavaScript, TypeScript, Metal, or beyond.** The tools may vary, but the logic remains the same.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### **My Usual Languages & Frameworks**  
- **Swift & SwiftUI** – Developing iOS apps with a modern, declarative UI.  
- **Metal** – Low-level graphics programming for high-performance rendering and shader development.  
- **JavaScript & TypeScript** – Writing maintainable, scalable, and efficient applications.  
- **React & Next.js** – Building fast, interactive, and SEO-friendly web applications.  
- **Node.js & Express.js** – Handling backend logic, APIs, and server-side operations.
- **Three.js & WebGL** – Creating interactive 3D experiences on the web.  
- **HTML & CSS** – Structuring and styling clean, responsive web layouts.  
- **SQL & NoSQL Databases** – Working with relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and non-relational (MongoDB, Firebase, Supabase) databases.  

### **Tools & Platforms**  
- **Xcode** – Primary development environment for iOS applications.  
- **Cursor** – AI-enhanced editor for faster and smarter coding, with VSCode plugins underneath.
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and seamless collaboration (I mean what other tool is there lol).
- **Firebase & Supabase** – Backend services for authentication, real-time databases, and cloud functions.  
- **AWS** – Experience with **AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, EC2**, and other cloud infrastructure for scalable deployment.  
- **Docker & CI/CD Pipelines** – Automating builds, testing, and deployment with tools like GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline.  

### **Testing & Debugging**  
- **Jest & React Testing Library** – Ensuring front-end stability with unit and integration tests.  
- **XCTest & XCTestUI** – Writing and automating tests for iOS applications.  
- **Postman & Thunder Client** – API testing and debugging for backend services.  
- **ESLint & Prettier** – Enforcing code quality and consistency across projects.  

## 🔍 Featured Projects

## 🎯 Development Philosophy  

I prioritize **efficiency, reliability, and adaptability.** My deep understanding of the underlying code architecture allows me to **transition seamlessly between different technologies** without being dependent on specific frameworks.

I focus on **writing clean, maintainable code** that delivers consistent performance and usability—whether for web applications, mobile apps, or graphics programming.
