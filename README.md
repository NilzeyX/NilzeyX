# Freelance Developer! 🚀

I'm a **Freelance Full-Stack Mobile & Web Developer** with **3 years of experience**, and over time, I’ve learned that **frameworks and languages change, but strong core skills remain valuable.**

Many developers rely on high-level tools that simplify programming, but I focus on **understanding the core mechanics behind the code**—allowing me to adapt, build efficiently, and deliver reliable applications across platforms.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### **My Preffered Languages & Frameworks**  
- **Swift & SwiftUI** – Developing iOS apps with a modern, declarative UI.
- **JavaScript & TypeScript** – Writing maintainable, scalable, and efficient applications.
- **React & Next.js** – Building fast, interactive, and SEO-friendly web applications.  
- **Node.js & Express.js** – Handling backend logic, APIs, and server-side operations.
- **HTML & CSS** – Structuring and styling clean, responsive web layouts.  
- **SQL & NoSQL Databases** – Working with relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and non-relational (MongoDB, Firebase, Supabase) databases.

### **Languages & Frameworks I have used**
- **Metal** – Low-level graphics programming for high-performance rendering and shader development.
- **Three.js & WebGL** – Creating interactive 3D experiences on the web.
- **Flutter & React Native** - Developing Cross platform apps or Android specific apps.
- **Python & Flask** – Writing automation scripts, backend services, and working with AI/ML libraries
- **Ruby on Rails** - Dashboards for CRUD, API deveolpments, Ecommerce Apps

### **Tools & Platforms**  
- **Xcode** – Primary development environment for iOS applications.  
- **Cursor** – AI-enhanced editor for faster and smarter coding, with VSCode plugins underneath.
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and seamless collaboration (I mean what other tool is there lol).
- **Firebase & Supabase** – Backend services for authentication, real-time databases, and cloud functions.  
- **AWS** – Experience with **AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, EC2**, and other cloud infrastructure for scalable deployment.  
- **Docker & CI/CD Pipelines** – Automating builds, testing, and deployment with tools like GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline.  

### **Testing & Debugging**  
- **Jest & React Testing Library** – Ensuring front-end stability with unit and integration tests.  
- **XCTest & XCTestUI** – Writing and automating tests for iOS applications.  
- **Postman & Thunder Client** – API testing and debugging for backend services.  
- **ESLint & Prettier** – Enforcing code quality and consistency across projects.

## 📌 My Approach to Development  

Being a freelancer you have to switch between new tools, therefore I chose to focus on **core programming concepts** that apply across all technologies:  

- **Algorithm Design & Computational Thinking** – Writing efficient logic, optimizing time and space complexity, and understanding recursion, sorting, and search algorithms.  
- **Mathematics & Physics** – Implementing real-world simulations, handling vector math, collision detection, and working with physics-based animations.  
- **Memory Management & Performance Optimization** – Understanding **Swift’s ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)**, **JavaScript’s garbage collection**, and how memory allocation affects performance.  
- **Inheritance, Protocols & Type Systems** – Using **Swift’s protocol-oriented programming**, **TypeScript’s type safety**, and **JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance** to write reusable, maintainable code.  
- **Compilers & Rendering Pipelines** – Understanding **Swift’s compilation process**, **JavaScript’s JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation**, and how rendering works in **Metal and WebGL** for efficient graphics.  
- **Networking & API Architecture** – Working with **REST and WebSockets**, optimizing API calls with **async/await**, and structuring backend services in **Node.js and Express**.  
- **UI & State Management** – Handling **SwiftUI’s declarative UI**, **React’s component lifecycle**, and managing state efficiently with **Redux, Zustand, or Swift Combine**.  

By focusing on these **core principles**, I can quickly adapt to different tech stacks—whether it's **Swift, JavaScript, Flutter, Python or beyond**. The specific tools may change, but the underlying knowledge remains applicable. This allows me to be versatile as a Freelancer for different projects.

## 🎯 Development Philosophy  

I prioritize **efficiency, reliability, and adaptability.** My deep understanding of the underlying code architecture allows me to **transition seamlessly between different technologies** without being dependent on specific frameworks.

I focus on **writing clean, maintainable code** that delivers consistent performance and usability—whether for web applications, mobile apps, or graphics programming.
