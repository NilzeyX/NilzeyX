# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio! 🚀

I'm a **Freelance Full-Stack Mobile & Web Developer** with **3 years of experience**, and over time, I’ve learned that **frameworks and languages change, but strong core skills remain valuable.**

Many developers rely on high-level tools that simplify programming, but I focus on **understanding the core mechanics behind the code**—allowing me to adapt, build efficiently, and deliver reliable applications across platforms.

## 📌 My Approach to Development  

Being a freelancer you have to switch between new tools, therefore I chose to focus on **core programming concepts** that apply across all technologies:  

- **Algorithm Design & Computational Thinking** – Writing efficient logic, optimizing time and space complexity, and understanding recursion, sorting, and search algorithms.  
- **Mathematics & Physics** – Implementing real-world simulations, handling vector math, collision detection, and working with physics-based animations.  
- **Memory Management & Performance Optimization** – Understanding **Swift’s ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)**, **JavaScript’s garbage collection**, and how memory allocation affects performance.  
- **Inheritance, Protocols & Type Systems** – Using **Swift’s protocol-oriented programming**, **TypeScript’s type safety**, and **JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance** to write reusable, maintainable code.  
- **Compilers & Rendering Pipelines** – Understanding **Swift’s compilation process**, **JavaScript’s JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation**, and how rendering works in **Metal and WebGL** for efficient graphics.  
- **Networking & API Architecture** – Working with **REST and WebSockets**, optimizing API calls with **async/await**, and structuring backend services in **Node.js and Express**.  
- **UI & State Management** – Handling **SwiftUI’s declarative UI**, **React’s component lifecycle**, and managing state efficiently with **Redux, Zustand, or Swift Combine**.  

By focusing on these **core principles**, I can quickly adapt to different tech stacks—whether it's **Swift, JavaScript, Flutter, Python or beyond**. The specific tools may change, but the underlying knowledge remains applicable. This allows me to be versatile as a Freelancer for different projects.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### **My Preffered Languages & Frameworks**  
- **Swift & SwiftUI** – Developing iOS apps with a modern, declarative UI.
- **JavaScript & TypeScript** – Writing maintainable, scalable, and efficient applications.
